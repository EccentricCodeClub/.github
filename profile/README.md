# Welcome to EccentricCodeClub

We embrace the quirky side of coding, focusing on fun and exploration. Coding unique or unusual projects just for the joy of doing it. Focus on learning and experimenting with no specific purpose in mind, just for the pleasure of seeing what is possible.

Follow us if you code weird stuff as a hobby.
